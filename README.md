# React-website-notes

This is a static notes app created using React.js, is a simple application that allows users to create, view, and delete notes. The app is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and does not require any backend server to store data.

This app typically consists of a home screen where users can see a list of their existing notes, and a note editor screen where they can create and edit notes. The note editor usually includes a text field where users can enter the contents of their note, and a save button to save the note.

Once a note is saved, it appears on the home screen where users can see a list of all their notes. From there, users can click on a note to view its contents, edit the note, or delete the note entirely.

It also include features such as search functionality, tags or categories to organize notes, and the ability to share notes with others. Since this app is static, the data stored in the app is typically stored in the user's browser's local storage, which means that the notes will persist even after the user closes the app.

Overall, it is a simple and user-friendly tool for managing notes without the need for a complex backend infrastructure.
